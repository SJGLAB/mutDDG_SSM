# mutDDG_SSM

Thermostability is a fundamental property of proteins to maintain their biological functions. Predicting protein stability changes upon mutation is important for our understanding protein structure-function relationship, and is also of great interest in protein engineering and pharmaceutical design. Here we present mutDDG-SSM, a deep learning-based framework that uses the geometric representations encoded in protein structure to predict the mutation-induced protein stability changes.
